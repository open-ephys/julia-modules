# julia-modules
julia ( http://julialang.org/ ) code for closed-loop experiments.

See http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/embedding/ for basic overview for the underlying mechanism of how the c++ code embeds julia.

These are to be used with the julia plugin in the open ephys GUI ( https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI ).
The julia plugin, as well as all the julia code here is currently in very early alpha status and will likely not work without some modifications. Get in touch via the google group if you're interested in using this.
